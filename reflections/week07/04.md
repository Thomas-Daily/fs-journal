## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
 - I don't know, I can't remember what the principles were. If I did anything, I think I mostly leaned into timeboxing a lot more and I think that did wonders for me.
2. What went well this week?
 - I think that I was able to put my head down and work. I usually struggle with this but I think I did super good.
3. What would you do differently?
 - Honeslty, I don't think I would do anything differently. I did pretty well.

## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

- The overall experience of a user. The styling, the accesability, and the help that the website can provide.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

- By needing the styling to make a good user experience, it forces the designer to make the page look good, thus increasing productivity.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

- Because if the UE is bad, then it is much less likely for the user to want to user your site again which means less gets sold.

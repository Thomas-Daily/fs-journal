## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have really enjoyed both the social and educational aspects of this course. I am worried a little about my timeboxing, but I believe that if I have the backend done by the end of Tuesday I should be good. Some stuff has happend over the weekend and I wasn't able to get much done on it. Hopefully this next week of class I can really crack down and get it all done.

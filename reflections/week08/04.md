## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

- Unit = Checks inputs to a given function, class, or composable are profucing the expected output or side effects.
- Component = Checks that your component mounts, renders, can be interacted with, and behaves as expected.
- End-to-end = Checks features that span multiple pages and make real network requests against your production-built Vue apllication.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

- Unit because I believe that checking functions and the outputs they provide is very important in the functionality of a website.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

- I think Component, just because there isnt much to test in and out. From my experience, it either works or it doesn't.

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

- To get a general outline of what the design of a website will look like.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

- There are loads of details you can put into a wire-frame, such as where you want each section and where you want things themselves in each section, and the more detail you can get the better the web developer can give you what you want.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- Yes, because the wire-frame allows you to have one concise idea. If you dont have one and you are just building it from your mind, your ideas can flow in random directions, causing your website to look convoluded and clunky.

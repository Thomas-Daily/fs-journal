## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

- To treat html as building blocks using row and columns. It helps me format the website before I even start putting in the information.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

- I think that looking at designs on google would help me come up with ideas myself as for what to do.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

- I think the cleaner the design is, the more it will stick in a person's brain. Not only that, but it shows the amount of effort put into the website, and it could give the viewer an impression of how much effort the designer gives into whatever is on the wewbsite.

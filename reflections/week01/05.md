# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
 - I think that I am starting to understand the basics of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
 - That Bootstrap was basically just CSS in the index.html.
- What are you struggling with?
 - I am struggling with going to bed at a decent time and getting enough sleep to fully function.
- What would you count as a victory?
 - I would count me attempting things, them not working and me figuring out the problem and fixing it as a victory this week.

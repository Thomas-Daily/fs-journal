## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

 - A pseudo-class defines the special state of an element, and we will probably be using things like :hover, :link, :active, and other ones that will help the functionality of the page.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

 - Specificity is when there are to conflicting CSS rules, the more specific one wins. This could be used as an advantage by trying two conflicting rules to see what would work better, and by making one more specific you could have it run over the other rule.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

 - Because the !important feature makes it so the program prioritizes that over other things, the over use of it may cause the program to become confused on what should be prioritized or not.

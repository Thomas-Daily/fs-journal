# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- Not a whole lot, got more comfortable with JS itself

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

- That organization just makes coding much harder, at least when you are doing small projects.

- What are you struggling with?

- I'm struggling very much with MVC


- What would you count as a victory?

- I honestly don't know. My Checkpoint is really bad, and I hope to get done by at the very lest tomorrow morning.

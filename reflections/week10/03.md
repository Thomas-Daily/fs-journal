## Questions

- Info in a column is generic info that each item is given, and in a coloumn is the exact item itself.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

- public int id {get; set;}
public string name { get; set; }
  public int age { get; set; }
  public string description { get; set; }

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

 - Delete removes it entirely whereas Drop removes the specific spot in the table
```

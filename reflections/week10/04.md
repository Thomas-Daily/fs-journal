## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

- An Enum is a piece of info that can be one of a few different options, but only those set options can be chosen. Like in a video game, an example would be easy, normal or hard.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

- By going in and either adding to the list of options or subtracting from it, but there is no way to interfere with it directly.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

- I have used enums in AllSpice by showing whether the cook time is long or not.

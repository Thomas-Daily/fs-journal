# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 

- It's going pretty good, managing my time pretty well.

- Are you managing your stress?

- Pretty well, trying to just power through this final.

- What has you most worried?

- I'm a little worried, cause although I finsished my backend today I haven't worked on my front end much, so I'm gonna need to crank a lot of that out at home.

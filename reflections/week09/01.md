## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

- We've been having a stand up meeting in the morning every day to understand what has to be done that day. We are also using figma as a base model as well as Trello, though we are slowly moving away from the two.

2. What went well so far?

- The workload to break balance ratio seems pretty good as well as the fact the the divide in workload between the team seems pretty managable as well.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

- I honestly wouldn't be doing anything differently because It all seems pretty good. One thing that I may change if I did this again was trying harder to see what else I could do. I can admit that I would sometimes slack off because we got bottlenecked and I didn't really try to look at what other functionallity I could have worked on.

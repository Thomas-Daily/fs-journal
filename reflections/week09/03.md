## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

- Is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in a printable ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

- It makes file sizes roughly 33% larger than their original binary representations, which means more data down the wire.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

- because using laptops and smaller pc's, we tend to have a lower amount of storage, thus making the file size larger in projects in a major detriment if you are wanting to keep multiple projects
